;;; If this namespace requires macros, remember that ClojureScript's
;;; macros are written in Clojure and have to be referenced via the
;;; :require-macros directive where the :as keyword is required, while in Clojure is optional. Even
;;; if you can add files containing macros and compile-time only
;;; functions in the :source-paths setting of the :builds, it is
;;; strongly suggested to add them to the leiningen :source-paths.
